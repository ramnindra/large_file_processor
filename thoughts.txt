1. Write code to mmap a big file to read in chunks in parallel.
2. Find start and end line number for each chunk
3. Count words each line parallel and write to its own file.
4. Let one thread merge all files. Since we are dealing with data in 
   files where order is important. Multiple threads can not help here.


1. Every chunk will create file with word frequency per line.
2. Every chunk will Lexigraphically sort 
3. Merge sort 2 files into one maintaining the sorted property.
4. Repeat step 3 until there is only one file.
